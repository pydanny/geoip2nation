# geoip2nation3 (archived)

Unmaintained legacy Python 3 project that I'm displaying here so people can access the code.

## Background

I hacked this together from someone else's work to get a Python 3 contract effort off the ground in 2018. The project ended, the repo was removed from GitHub, and the laptop I coded it on was bricked. 

This code was taken from the wheel of the package on PyPI. It doesn't include any tests or docs I might have written at the time. Except for this `README` and the `.gitignore` file, this is exactly what is on PyPI.

I don't know if this works, nor do I have time to support it, but it is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geoip2nation3/).
